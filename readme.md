# Module Structure Cleaner 

## Overview
This program reads a text file selected by the user, cleans its content by removing ANSI escape codes and replacing Unicode box-drawing characters with ASCII equivalents, and saves the cleaned content to a new output file. It uses the `rfd` crate for file dialog functionality, regex for ANSI code removal, and standard Rust I/O libraries for file operations.

## Functionality

### Main Workflow
1. **Input File Selection**: The program uses the `rfd::FileDialog` to prompt the user to select a text file as the input.
2. **Output File Naming**: The output file name is generated by appending `_output` to the base name of the input file.
3. **File Processing**:
   - Reads the input file line by line.
   - Cleans each line by removing ANSI escape codes and converting Unicode box-drawing characters to their ASCII equivalents.
   - Writes the cleaned lines to the output file.
4. **Completion Notification**: Prints messages to the console to indicate the process and output file location.

### Key Components

#### File Selection
- **Library**: `rfd::FileDialog`
- **Functionality**: Opens a file selection dialog and filters for `.txt` files.

#### Cleaning Text
- **Function**: `clean_text(input: &str) -> String`
  - Removes ANSI escape codes using a regular expression.
  - Replaces various Unicode box-drawing characters with ASCII equivalents.
  - Returns the cleaned text.

#### File I/O
- Opens the input file using `File::open`.
- Writes the cleaned data to the output file using `File::create` and `writeln!`.

## Example Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Select a `.txt` file from the file dialog.
3. The program processes the file and creates an output file in the same directory with `_output` appended to its name.
4. View the cleaned text in the output file.

## Dependencies
- **rfd**: For file dialog functionality.
- **regex**: For matching ANSI escape codes.
- **std**: For standard file and I/O operations.

## Notes
- Ensure the `rfd` and `regex` crates are added to the `Cargo.toml` file:
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  rfd = "0.11"
  regex = "1.7"
  ```
- This program assumes UTF-8 encoding for text files.
- Error handling is minimal; ensure input files exist and are accessible.
